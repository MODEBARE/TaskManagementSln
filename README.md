Authentication and Authorization
This project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization. To access protected endpoints, you must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests. You can obtain a JWT token by authenticating with the API.

Background Services
The project includes background services powered by Hangfire for sending due date reminders, checking task completion, and checking new task assignments. These services run periodically and automatically in the background. You can configure the schedule and behavior of these services in the Hangfire configuration.

Error Handling
The API handles errors gracefully and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for different types of errors, including validation errors and not found errors.
